# Todo-Rust-Axum-Askama-HTMX

This project is a todo list web application built with Rust, leveraging the power of the Axum framework, Askama for templating, HTMX for AJAX calls, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **Axum**: A modern Rust web framework built for async programming.
- **Askama**: A type-safe, compiled template engine for Rust.
- **HTMX**: Allows access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
